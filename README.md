# stock

The idea of this repo is from [this article](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/10/predicting-stock-price-machine-learningnd-deep-learning-techniques-python/)
on Analytics Vidhya. The original article provides several techniques to predict stock prices 
and LSTM seems to outperform the others. However, I discovered some mistakes of the comparisons which is not very fair,
just the same as what some other readers commented under the old article.

Thus, in the first chapter, I provide the fair comparison and the code here, as well as the comparisons between real price, predicted price,
and also the (not fair) predicted price of old article. I keep most of the old code in order to make a fair comparison.
The first chapter shows awesome result.

Then, we may raise up a question. Could we use this model to predict other stocks? In other words, could one model predict multiple stocks very well? In order to get the answer, we provide the second chapter.

The last thing we are doing, surely, is to make it an application. In the last chapter, we provide a list of stocks, and we want to make the prediction every one or two days, or weeks, depending on your preference. And we use this model to give the most promising stocks.

Then we could buy it, right?? hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
